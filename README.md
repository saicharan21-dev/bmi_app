# BMI APP

## Key Features

### BMI Calculation: The app calculates the user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their input of weight and height. BMI is a standard measure used to assess a person's body weight in relation to their height.

#### Health Assessment: The app provides a health assessment based on the calculated BMI. It categorizes the user into one of the following groups:

#### Underweight: If the BMI indicates that the user is underweight, the app changes the background color to red, signifying potential health concerns associated with insufficient weight.
### Healthy Weight: If the BMI falls within the healthy weight range, the background color turns green, indicating a balanced body weight.
### Overweight: When the BMI suggests that the user is overweight, the app changes the background color to orange, indicating the need for attention to weight management.
### Input Validation: The app ensures that user inputs for weight and height are within reasonable ranges, preventing unrealistic or extreme values that might skew the BMI calculation.

### User-Friendly Interface: The app features an intuitive and user-friendly interface with clearly labeled input fields, a "Calculate" button, and easy-to-read results.

### Visual Feedback: The background color change provides a visual and intuitive way for users to quickly assess their health status, making the app engaging and informative.

### Feedback Messages: The app provides feedback messages or labels to accompany the BMI result, helping users understand their health assessment and any recommended actions.

### These features collectively make your BMI Calculator app a valuable tool for users to monitor and assess their health and body weight, providing a quick and easy way to gauge their fitness status.
